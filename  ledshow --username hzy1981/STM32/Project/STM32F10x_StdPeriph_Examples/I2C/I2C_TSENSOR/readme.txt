@par Example Description 

This example provides a description of how to use the I2C to communicate with 
an STLM75 (or a compatible device) I2C temperature sensor is mounted on the 
evaluation board and used to get instantaneous external temperature
(-55°C to +125°C).
Thanks to STM32 I2C SMBus feature, we can easiley monitor the temperature 
variations. This is managed by the SMBus Alert which is generating a dedicated 
interrupt informing the system that the temperature is out of the selected 
ranges.
The user can configure the TOS and THYS thanks to a dedicated define values in 
the code.
  
   #define TEMPERATURE_THYS 31
   #define TEMPERATURE_TOS 32

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, High-Density
    Value line, Medium-Density, XL-Density, Medium-Density Value line, Low-Density 
    and Low-Density Value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32100E-EVAL (High-Density
    Value line), STM32100B-EVAL (Medium-Density Value line), STM3210E-EVAL (High-Density
    and XL-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL (Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be 
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM3210E-EVAL Set-up
    @note The jumper 11 must be fitted.

  - STM32100E-EVAL Set-up
    @note The jumper 6 must be set in position 2<->3
