@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the FSMC to drive the OneNAND memory mounted 
on STM32100E-EVAL board. 

In this example a basic example of how to use the FSMC firmware library and
an associate driver to perform read/write operations on the KFG1216U2A OneNAND
memory.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x High-density value line Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM32100E-EVAL and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.
    Make sure that the jumper JP6 is in position 2<->3

    
@par How to use it ? 
In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files :
  - misc.c
  - stm32f10x_dma.c
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c
  - stm32f10x_i2c.c
  - stm32f10x_fsmc.c
  - stm32f10x_usart.c
  - stm32f10x_exti.c
  - stm32_eval.c (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)  
  - stm32100e_eval_fsmc_onenand.c (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL\STM32100E_EVAL)   
   
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example

@note
